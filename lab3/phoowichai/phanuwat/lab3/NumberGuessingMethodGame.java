/**
* Write a Java program called NumberGuessingMethodGame.
* The program defines at least two subroutines, namely genAnswer(), and playGame() described below.
* The program also contains a static int variable answer which contains the answer of the game.
* The main of the program should be as shown.
* genAnswer() is a static void subroutine that will generate the answer and then store the value in the variable answer.
* playGame() is a static void subroutine that runs the game.
* The subroutine performs the following steps: 1.reads in the input
* 2.displays appropriate output 3.decrements the remaining guess.
* It repeats the steps if there are numbers of guesses remain or the correct answer has not been entered.
